jCERS is a registration system which consists of a desktop client as 
well as web application. The system allows to perform essential operations 
like student registration, tuition charging and grade input among other tasks. 
The acronym stands for Java Continuing Education Registration System and was 
modeled and drew inspiration from a system with a similar name called CERS 
which was implemented in .NET technology and is used today internally by
